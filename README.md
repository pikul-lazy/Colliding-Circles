**Inspiration: **
We were bored, and we thought of circles

**What it does: **
It is two-player tag, play from the same computer (or from different computers using REPLIT!) There is a time of 20 seconds, and the red circle has to tag the blue one

**How we built it: **
Python, Pygame, Asyncio

**Challenges we ran into: **
The start page wasn't working,

**Accomplishments that we're proud of: **
We fixed everything and made it work, we did it as one of our first big projects

**What we learned: **
How to use Pygame

**What's next for Colliding Circles: **
Adding portals and obstacles

**How to play: **
WASD for Red,
Arrows for Cyan,
If 20 secs are up, Cyan wins
If Red touches Cyan, Red wins
Have fun!
