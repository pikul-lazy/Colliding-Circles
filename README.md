**Inspiration:** 
We were bored, and we thought of circles

**What it does:** 
It is two-player tag, play from the same computer (or from different computers using replit!) There is a time of 20 seconds, and the red circle has to tag the blue one

**How we built it:** 
Python, Pygame, using the platform repl.it

**Challenges we ran into:** 
The start page wasn't working, the code was messy, it took us a while to get the collisions to work, and we tried to add multiplayer for a long while

**Accomplishments that we're proud of:** 
We fixed everything and made it work, we did it as each our first big project; Also, we found a creative math-related fix to the collision problem

**What we learned:** 
How to use Pygame

**What's next for Colliding Circles:** 
Adding portals, obstacles, and a limited speed boost

**Built With:** 
Python, Pygame

**How to play:** 
WASD for Red
Arrows for Cyan
If Red touches Cyan, Red wins
If time runs out, Cyan wins

**Have fun!**
